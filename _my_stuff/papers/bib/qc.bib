  abstract={The Mach-Zehnder interferometer is a particularly simple device for demonstrating interference by division of amplitude. A light beam is first split into two parts by a beamsplitter and then recombined by a second beamsplitter. Depending on the relative phase acquired by the beam along the two paths the second beamsplitter will reflect the beam with efficiency between 0 and 100%. The operation of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer is often used as an example in quantum mechanics because it shows a clear path-choice problem. However, it is not at all obvious at first glance that it works as claimed, until reflection phase shifts are considered in detail.}

	Abstract = {In the last few years, theoretical study of quantum systems serving as computational devices has achieved tremendous progress. We now have strong theoretical evidence that quantum computers, if built, might be used as a dramatically powerful computational tool. This review is about to tell the story of theoretical quantum computation. I left out the developing topic of experimental realizations of the model, and neglected other closely related topics which are quantum information and quantum communication. As a result of narrowing the scope of this paper, I hope it has gained the benefit of being an almost self contained introduction to the exciting field of quantum computation.},

@misc{Henault:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Optical lossless beam splitters are frequently encountered in fundamental physics experiments regarding the nature of light, including "which-way" determination of light particles, N. Bohr's complementarity principle, or the EPR paradox and all their measurement apparatus. Although they look as common optical components at first glance, their behaviour remains somewhat mysterious since they apparently exhibit stand-alone particle-like features, and then wave-like characteristics when inserted into a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. In this communication are examined and discussed some basic properties of these beamssplitters, both from a classical optics and quantum physics point of view. Herein some convergences and contradictions are highlighted, and the results of a few emblematic experiments demonstrating photon existence are discussed. An alternative empirical model in wave optics is also proposed in order to shed light on some remaining questions},
